Overview of the final project in OPS

The code file is an implementation of Proportional-Derivative control that aims to decrease the oscillations about the straight path over time. The goal of this project was to create an autonomous bot that would travel a minitaure micromouse maze (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/abxItBZPi3o/hqdefault.jpg) without stopping. Using the infrared light sensors values as input, the code would respond appropiately determine to move straight, right, or left. The sensors simple pass a higher value the closer to a wall the mouse is. Unfortunately; we could only complete part of the maze as the mouse's front was simply too wide to complete turns( turns out the sharp edge kept getting caught on the walls' grooves when turning). This will be noted next year for future mouse projects! This project was invaluable as an opportunity to combine both code logic and circuitry knowledge to produce a well functioning outcome.
